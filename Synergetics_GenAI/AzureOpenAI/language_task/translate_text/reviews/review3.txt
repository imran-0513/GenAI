Some of the staff could be friendlier, especially for the amount of money you're paying to spend some days 
in San Francisco. Some of the customers were really shabby, they were loud, misbehaved at the lobby, 
it felt like being right on Tenderloin.But this wasn't the fault of the hotel.At the end, 
it was one of the better hotels we stayed at in San Francisco during our last 3 trips, 
even though there's nothing to brag about it. The city definitely needs some improvement for the tourism.
