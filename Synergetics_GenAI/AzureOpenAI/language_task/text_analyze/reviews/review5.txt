Staff are terrible....front desk guys were worst and indifferent..
i went with family and they have no consideration...rooms are worst quality...
AC is broken and beds have bugs in it...gloomy ambience...it is a mess in the middle of a messy location.
only reason to book is its proximity to NDLS station
